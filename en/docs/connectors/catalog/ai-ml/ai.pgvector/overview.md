# pgvector Connector Overview

pgvector is a PostgreSQL extension that adds support for vector similarity search, enabling storage and retrieval of high-dimensional embeddings alongside relational data. The Ballerina `ballerinax/ai.pgvector` connector (v1.0.3) provides a `VectorStore` client that implements the `ai:VectorStore` interface, allowing you to add, query, and delete vector entries in a PostgreSQL database with pgvector installed.


## Key features

- Store dense, sparse, and hybrid vector embeddings in PostgreSQL with pgvector
- Similarity search using cosine, Euclidean, or Manhattan distance metrics
- Automatic table and HNSW index creation on initialization
- Metadata filtering on queries with composable AND/OR filter conditions
- Configurable vector dimensions and embedding types (dense, sparse, hybrid)
- Bulk insertion of vector entries with associated content chunks and metadata
- Delete entries by single ID or batch of IDs

## Actions

Actions are operations you invoke on PostgreSQL with pgvector from your integration — adding vector entries, querying for similar vectors, and deleting entries. The pgvector connector exposes actions through a single client:


| Client | Actions |
|--------|---------|
| `Vector Store` | Add, query, and delete vector embeddings with similarity search |

See the **[Action Reference](action-reference.md)** for the full list of operations, parameters, and sample code for each client.

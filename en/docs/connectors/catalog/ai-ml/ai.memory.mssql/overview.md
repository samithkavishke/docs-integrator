# AI Memory MSSQL Connector Overview

The `ballerinax/ai.memory.mssql` connector provides a Microsoft SQL Server–backed short-term memory store for AI agent conversations. It implements the `ai:ShortTermMemoryStore` interface from the `ballerina/ai` module, enabling persistent, key-scoped storage and retrieval of chat messages (system, user, assistant, and function roles) with optional in-memory caching and configurable message-count limits.


## Key features

- MSSQL-backed persistence of chat messages across system, user, assistant, and function roles
- Implements the `ai:ShortTermMemoryStore` interface for seamless integration with Ballerina AI agents
- Key-scoped message storage allowing independent conversation histories per session or user
- Optional in-memory caching layer (`cache:CacheConfig`) to reduce database round-trips
- Configurable maximum interactive message count per key with `isFull` and `getCapacity` helpers
- Auto-creates the `ChatMessages` table on initialisation — no manual schema setup required
- Accepts either a pre-configured `mssql:Client` or a `DatabaseConfiguration` record for flexible connection setup
- Thread-safe (`isolated`) implementation suitable for concurrent Ballerina services

## Actions

Actions are operations you invoke on the MSSQL memory store from your integration — storing chat messages, retrieving conversation history, and managing message lifecycle. All operations are exposed on the `mssql:ShortTermMemoryStore` class.


| Client | Actions |
|--------|---------|
| `Short Term Memory Store` | Store, retrieve, and remove chat messages (system, interactive) keyed by session ID; capacity checks |

See the **[Action Reference](action-reference.md)** for the full list of operations, parameters, and sample code for each client.

# DeepSeek Connector Overview

DeepSeek is an AI company that provides powerful large language models for chat completion and reasoning tasks. The Ballerina `ballerinax/ai.deepseek` connector (v1.1.1) provides programmatic access to DeepSeek's LLM chat completion models, enabling you to integrate AI-powered chat and structured data generation into your Ballerina integration flows.


## Key features

- Chat completion using DeepSeek's LLM models with multi-turn conversation support
- Structured output generation that maps LLM responses directly to Ballerina types (records, arrays, primitives)
- Tool/function calling support for agentic workflows
- Support for both `deepseek-chat` and `deepseek-reasoner` models
- Tagged template literal prompts for safe and expressive prompt construction
- Implements the standard `ballerina/ai:ModelProvider` interface for interoperability with the Ballerina AI ecosystem
- GraalVM native image compatible for high-performance deployments

## Actions

Actions are operations you invoke on DeepSeek from your integration — sending chat messages, generating structured outputs, and using tool calls. The DeepSeek connector exposes actions through a single client:


| Client | Actions |
|--------|---------|
| `Model Provider` | Chat completion, structured generation, tool/function calling |

See the **[Action Reference](action-reference.md)** for the full list of operations, parameters, and sample code for each client.

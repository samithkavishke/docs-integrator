# Section 8: GenAI

**Question this section answers:** "How do I build AI agents, RAG apps, or MCP servers?"

**Audience:** Developer building AI-powered integrations. May be new to LLMs/agents or experienced with Python AI frameworks but new to Ballerina.

**Tone:** Practical, hands-on. Explain AI concepts briefly, then show how to build with WSO2 Integrator. Not an AI textbook — just enough theory to build things.

**AI Split Rule:** This section is about YOU building AI-powered things. AI that helps YOU code faster (Copilot, AI suggestions) stays in Develop.

### Page: What is a Natural Function?

**File:** `en/docs/genai/key-concepts/what-is-natural-function.md`

**What to cover:**
- Ballerina's unique `natural` function concept
- Function signature defined by developer, implementation by LLM
- When to use: classification, extraction, summarization, translation
- Simple example: sentiment analysis as a natural function

### Page: What is an AI Agent?

**File:** `en/docs/genai/key-concepts/what-is-ai-agent.md`

**What to cover:**
- Agent = LLM + Tools + Memory
- How agents reason and decide which tool to use
- Difference from direct LLM calls
- Visual: Agent loop diagram (observe → think → act)

### Page: What are Tools?

**File:** `en/docs/genai/key-concepts/what-are-tools.md`

**What to cover:**
- Tools are functions the agent can call
- Tool definition: name, description, parameters
- How the LLM decides which tool to use (function calling)
- Tools can be: database queries, API calls, file operations, other integrations

### Page: What is AI Agent Memory?

**File:** `en/docs/genai/key-concepts/what-is-agent-memory.md`

**What to cover:**
- Short-term memory (conversation context)
- Long-term memory (persistent across sessions)
- Memory backends: in-memory, database, vector store
- When to use memory vs stateless agents

### Page: What is MCP?

**File:** `en/docs/genai/key-concepts/what-is-mcp.md`

**What to cover:**
- Model Context Protocol — open standard for AI tool connectivity
- Why MCP: standardized interface between agents and tools
- How MCP works: server exposes tools, client (agent) consumes them
- WSO2 Integrator as both MCP server and MCP client
- Link to: MCP Integration pages

### Page: What is RAG?

**File:** `en/docs/genai/key-concepts/what-is-rag.md`

**What to cover:**
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation in one paragraph
- Three steps: Chunking → Embedding → Querying
- When to use RAG: company knowledge bases, document Q&A, support bots
- RAG vs fine-tuning (briefly)
- Link to: RAG development pages

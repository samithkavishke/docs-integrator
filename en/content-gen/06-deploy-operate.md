# Section 10: Deploy & Operate

**Question this section answers:** "How do I ship, run, and secure this?"

**Audience:** Developer or DevOps engineer deploying integrations to production. Has a working integration from Develop and needs to get it running in a real environment.

**Tone:** Practical, operations-focused. Include exact commands, config files, and YAML snippets. Cover failure modes and what to do when things go wrong.

**Boundary rule:** If the code is still on your machine → Develop. Once you're shipping it → Deploy & Operate. This applies to ALL integration types including GenAI agents.
